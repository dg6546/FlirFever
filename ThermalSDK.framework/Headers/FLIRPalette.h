/**
 *  Defines a palette representation, which can be applied to the ThermalImage in order to display it in specified colors.
 *  The palette is a set of colors applied to the temperature or signal data stored in the ThermalImage.
 *  Thanks to that each temperature / signal value can be displayed in specific color.
 *  This creates a visual representation of the ThermalImage.
 *  A Palette's object cannot be created directly.
 *  It can be obtained from ThermalImage by calling ThermalImage.getPalette() method.
 *  This method will always return an Palette instance.
 *  A ThermalImage has to have palette set in order to be presented to the User.
 *
 *  The Palette for ThermalImage can be changed. In order to get the other palettes a PaletteManager class should be used.
 *  It can provide the list of predefined palettes and allows to load more palettes as well from a user-defined location.
